Having the best privacy space. Try the Villa at the top. 3. All rooms have a different beach view 4. Very good Hotel Architecture 5. All rooms have a private pool. 6. What other facilities in the general room are complete. 7. The hotel waiter is very nice, and friendly. 8. Try Thai massage there. eat üëç 9. and try BBQ at the Villa, create a super romantic atmosphere with your partner. but plus chef&#39;s advice too. 10. Thai cash food? quiet. how come when you breakfast. Complete. 11. Afraid of money? the receptionist can be a tapestry of money 12. Even though the location is super private, it is quiet they have a shuttel for kong pong, the airport and other locations can ask for a taxi to be prepared. 13. There is welcome drink, food, and fruit too. and drinks in the pantry either aqua or soda free refil every day 14. The ingredients are recommended. üëç",
